<p>As much for my own reference as for anything else, I'd like to take down some notes for how I got all this stuff setup and linked together. </p>

<p>I'll save the high minded consideration of what it means to have an identity in these modern times for another day, for now this is just going to be some boring stuff about what services I signed up for, and in what order.</p>

<p>You'll note that so far all of this has been free.  This is in no small part because it's (so far, anyway) really hard to pay for something without leaving a very obvious paper-trail.  Amusingly, paying with paper money leaves seems to be the least trail-leaving option I know of at the moment.</p>

<h4>Computer / OS</h4>

<p>I'm using <a href="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a> on a USB stick which I fire up on an old junker laptop when I need to. </p>

<p>In a move that is perhaps less well considered, I'm doing this with a <a href="https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/persistence/index.en.html">persistent volume</a>, though I think the passphrase I've got will suffice for the time being. </p>

<h4>Email</h4>

<p>To sign up for things on the internet, you need an email address.  I had originally wanted to find a provider that would both be privacy-minded as well as offer free POP/IMAP access since I'm partial to Icedove over having to use a browser based client. Also I had to be able to sign up via Tor, of course. </p>

<p>With that in mind, I found a useful list over at <strong>the simple computer</strong> in <a href="http://thesimplecomputer.info/free-webmail-for-better-privacy">Free Webmail for Better Privacy</a> and started working down it. </p>

<p>I attempted signups in quite a few of these but for reasons that I can't remember clearly any longer, I ended up giving up after having managed to successfully get setup with <a href="https://unseen.is/">Unseen.is</a>.  The origin-email for this was provided by some disposable email website. </p>

<h4>Domain</h4>

<p>With my fancy email address in hand, I headed over to <a href="http://www.dot.tk/">dot.tk</a> to claim myself a domain.  This proved slightly more difficult than I had originally expected owing to the fact that the registration process seemed to rely on a lot of scripts that didn't reliably work in the Tor Browser. </p>

<h4>Hosting</h4>

<p><a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> still supports <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/">using a Custom Domain</a> so I went with them.  </p>

<h4>Twitter</h4>

<p>I wanted to get Twitter setup for no particular reason but to see if I could, and at first it was a challenge since like many other major web services these days, a phone number was required as part of my setup. I'm not sure if this is universal or limited to somebody coming from Tor.</p>

<h5>A Phone Number</h5>

<p>To get around this, I had to find a phone number to use.  Lots of the public websites offer very open sms endpoints but these seem to be largely blocked for the purpose of signing up for things. </p>

<p>Instead, I found that it is possible to get a SMS-able number through a service called <a href="http://www.textnow.com/">TextNow</a>, with which I could then sign up for Twitter.</p>

<h4>Other Remarks</h4>

<p>There's a host of other services I signed up for just to see if I could, or, because I thought it might be useful later.  The full list is tucked safely away in a Keepass vault along with all of the ridiculous passwords it generated for me. I hope to eventually put more of these to use, but this seems like an adequate start. </p>
